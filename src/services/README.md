# Services

Business logic that doesn't belong in components or needs to be reusable, lives inside of a service (inside the service folder). Right now the only service we have is an API service. This is also the one you will be extending.

The API manager is a file that has a basic implementation of Axios. It gets passed as a dependency to the API service.
